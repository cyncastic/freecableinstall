    %strong 911 DIALING:
    Enhanced 911 or E911 service is a North American telecommunications based system that automatically associates a physical address with the calling party's telephone number, and routes the call to the most appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) for that address. The caller’s address and information is displayed to the PSAP calltaker immediately upon call arrival. This provides emergency responders with the location of the emergency without the person calling for help having to provide it. It is the Customer’s sole responsibility to make sure that the proper physical address for their location is associated with their phone number.  If the physical address changes, or Customer transfers the phone number out of their location, they must notify Maxsip of the address change in order for E911 to operate properly. The system only works in North America if 911 is called. Calls made to other telephone numbers, even though they may be listed as an emergency telephone number, may not permit this feature to function correctly. All Customers are automatically enrolled in E911 services and are charged a one time setup fee of $15.00 and a recurring monthly fee of $1.95 for the E911 service.  These fees are subject to change at any time.  Customers may opt out of E911 service and must do so in writing. Customer acknowledges, understands and agrees that dialing 911 without having E911 service will result in a charge of $85.00 on their bill for each call made to 911.
